'''
Write a simple enumeration algorithm, either recursive or iterative, that
prints all k-mers consisting of 5 letters {-, A, C, G, T}. Compare the time of
both recursive and iterative approaches and mention the time complexity of
the algorithm

Although this approach is O(5^l) , also the space memory becoz of list is of 5^l .thus it crashes for large numbers

a=['A','C','G','T','-']
def kmers(k):
    if k-1==0:
        return a
    else:
        a1=kmers(k-1)
        a2=kmers(1)
        i=0
        j=0
        a3=[]
        for i in range(len(a1)):
            for j in range(len(a2)):
                str=""
                str=str+a1[i]+a2[j]
